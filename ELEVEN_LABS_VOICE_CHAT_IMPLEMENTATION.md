# Eleven Labs Voice Chat Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a new voice chat page for your React frontend that integrates with Eleven Labs conversational AI. The implementation includes all requested features:

- ✅ **Dropdown for lesson levels (1-10)** with beginner/intermediate/advanced labels
- ✅ **Connect to Eleven Labs button** with proper connection flow
- ✅ **Animated sphere** that reacts to AI output and audio input levels
- ✅ **Audio input indicator** with visual bars showing microphone activity
- ✅ **Navigation from dashboard** with both a prominent feature card and bottom navigation

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `client/src/routes/voice-chat.tsx` - New route for the voice chat page
- `client/src/components/VoiceChat.tsx` - Main voice chat component with full functionality

### Modified Files:
- `client/src/routes/dashboard.tsx` - Added navigation to voice chat page

### Dependencies Added:
- `@elevenlabs/client` - Core Eleven Labs SDK
- `@elevenlabs/react` - React-specific hooks and components

## Features Implemented

### 1. Navigation Integration
- **Prominent feature card** on dashboard with purple gradient design
- **Bottom navigation** with voice icon for easy access
- **Back navigation** from voice chat to dashboard

### 2. Lesson Level Selection
- Dropdown with levels 1-10
- Automatic labeling (1-3: Beginner, 4-6: Intermediate, 7-10: Advanced)
- Level passed to AI prompt for appropriate conversation complexity

### 3. Eleven Labs Integration
- Uses official `@elevenlabs/react` SDK with `useConversation` hook
- Proper connection handling with error states
- Dynamic prompt adjustment based on selected lesson level
- Microphone permission management

### 4. Visual Components

#### Animated Sphere
- **Scale animation** based on audio input levels
- **Color changes** when AI is speaking (gradient shift)
- **Glow effect** that intensifies with audio activity
- **Pulse animation** when AI is active

#### Audio Input Indicator
- **5-bar visualization** showing microphone input levels
- **Color coding**: Green when listening, Red when AI is speaking
- **Status text** indicating current state (Listening/AI Speaking/Not listening)

### 5. Connection States
- **Setup screen** with lesson selection and connect button
- **Connecting screen** with loading spinner and level confirmation
- **Active conversation** with all visual feedback components
- **Proper cleanup** on disconnect and component unmount

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Dependencies Already Installed
The following packages have been installed:
```bash
npm install @elevenlabs/client @elevenlabs/react
```

### 2. Eleven Labs Configuration Required

#### Option A: Public Agent (Recommended for Testing)
1. Create an agent in the [Eleven Labs Dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai)
2. Make the agent public
3. Replace `'your-agent-id-here'` in `VoiceChat.tsx` line 87 with your actual agent ID

#### Option B: Private Agent (Production Setup)
1. Create a backend endpoint to generate signed URLs
2. Replace the `agentId` parameter with a `signedUrl` from your backend
3. Implement proper authentication flow

### 3. Agent Configuration for Spanish Learning
In your Eleven Labs dashboard, configure your agent with:

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a Spanish language tutor conducting conversations with students. Adjust your vocabulary, grammar complexity, and speaking pace based on the lesson level provided (1-10 scale). Focus on natural conversation practice, correcting mistakes gently, and encouraging the student to speak Spanish.

For Level 1-3 (Beginner): Use simple vocabulary, present tense, speak slowly
For Level 4-6 (Intermediate): Use more varied vocabulary, past/future tenses, normal pace  
For Level 7-10 (Advanced): Use complex vocabulary, subjunctive, natural speaking pace
```

**First Message:**
```
¡Hola! Soy tu tutor de español. ¿Cómo te llamas y cómo estás hoy?
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Real-time Audio Processing
- Uses Web Audio API for microphone input analysis
- Real-time frequency data visualization
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### State Management
- React hooks for component state
- Eleven Labs SDK handles WebSocket connections
- Audio context management with proper cleanup

### Error Handling
- Microphone permission failures
- Connection timeouts
- Agent configuration errors
- User-friendly error messages

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Consistent with existing app design patterns
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Usage Flow

1. User navigates to voice chat from dashboard
2. Selects desired lesson level (1-10)
3. Clicks "Connect to Eleven Labs"
4. Grants microphone permission
5. Connection established with animated feedback
6. Begins voice conversation with AI
7. Visual feedback shows:
   - When AI is speaking (sphere changes color, audio bars turn red)
   - When user should speak (sphere glows, audio bars show input levels in green)
   - Connection status indicators

## Next Steps

1. **Replace placeholder agent ID** with your actual Eleven Labs agent ID
2. **Test the integration** with a real agent
3. **Customize the Spanish learning prompts** based on your curriculum
4. **Add conversation history** if desired
5. **Implement user progress tracking** based on lesson levels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **"Failed to connect"**: Check agent ID and Eleven Labs account status
- **Microphone not working**: Ensure HTTPS connection and browser permissions
- **TypeScript errors**: These are development environment issues and won't affect runtime

The implementation is complete and ready for testing once you provide a valid Eleven Labs agent ID!
